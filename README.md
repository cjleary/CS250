How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? User Stories is a summary of what the users what to see in the final product. They are essential to the development and evolution of the final product. You interpret and implement user needs into a program by listening, summarizing and incorporating what they would like to see in a way that helps the whole rather then just a few. Also keeping in communication and speaking with many users rather then just a few also help with this. 
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? Working on a team and keeping communication with those you work with on a program. I hope to not only have the chance to work with a team with good, open communication but also the framework of develop, test and repeat until the product is at its best. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? Keep open communication. Share insights and concerns as they come up rather then sitting on them and letting a problem get worse. Take responsiblity and own up when something has gone wrong. Step up when you have a skillset that is needed and offer to take a position you might not have taken otherwise.
